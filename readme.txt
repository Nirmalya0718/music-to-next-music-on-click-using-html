This is just a simple project of music play button (one music will play continuously in the background but when button is clicked then background music will be paused and second music will start to play).

--> two music is given already for testing purpose you can download it and play it.
--> here also hover effect is added to the button and on hovering it will change its colour and also border-radius also 
--> sometimes it has been seen that on running this snippet background music does not play but on click it start to play due to some browser issue. 
-->Google Chrome browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.

**** BACKGROUND MUSIC --> "indian-oriental...mp3"
****alternate MUSIC-->"Mischief....mp3"

-->here a music will be played in the background and on button pressed next music will start to play and background music will be stopped. It may have chance that on site opening background music will not be played at first but on key pressed next music will be played and on again button pressed background music will start to play and recent music will be stopped.

--> It is working on microsoft edge but sometimes background music will not played at first.
--> I have also tried with <embed> but the same problem remains otherwise the code is working good.
